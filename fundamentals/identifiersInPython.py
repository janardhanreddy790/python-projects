# identifiers in python are used to recognise a variable , function, class name etc.
# In Python how you can identify its name is based on its name.
# Variable is also called as identifiers it is a synonym.


# The followings rules will apply to define the identifiers.
    # Identifiers can be lower or uppercase (like classes , definitions, functions etc and are case sensitive)
    # digits also can be part of identifiers meaning any name can contain the digits but it should not start with digits
    # Allows underscores
    # Any variable starts with '_' underscore then it is called private variable if it doesnt start with '_' then it is called public variable
    # it is not allowed to any keywords as a variable or identifiers.



#Example For identifier:
name= "What is my name ?"
print(name)  # Here the 'name' is declared in line above is used in this line to print , if we change the variable name 'Name'/'NAME' or any changes it doesn't work.


#Example For identifier as digits:
# Valid Names
name1="hello"  # Allowed
#1name="Bye" # Not allowed


#Example For identifier with '_' (underscore) :
first_name="programming" #valid name
print(first_name)


# Example for private variable
_firstName="programming1"
print(_firstName)



# Example for invalid usage of keywords

#def=name # it is not allowed use keyword as a variable or identifier.

# NOTE: Every variable has a memory assigned for it.
